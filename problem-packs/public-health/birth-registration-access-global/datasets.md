## Classification Notes

The UNICEF birth-registration database 2026 update is a current downloadable country-series source for framing and source selection. Its survey timing and country-level grain remain explicit limitations; it is not a substitute for district-level CRVS tabulations or a current administrative denominator.

### Usable

- **UNICEF birth registration database and 2024 update**: Use for global and country framing plus the distinction between unregistered children and children reportedly registered without documentary proof. Limitation: this is a synthesis layer over underlying surveys, not a substitute for survey microdata when choosing districts or health-touchpoint wedges.
- **DHS birth-registration indicators and microdata guide**: Use when the question is specifically about under-5 registration status and certificate possession at the time of interview. Limitation: DHS does not measure administrative completeness of live births inside the legal registration window, so it cannot be treated as a CRVS performance metric.
- **MICS birth-registration module and survey tools**: Use when MICS is the best country source for under-5 registration and proof-of-registration measures. Limitation: module availability is not equal to released, district-usable microdata, so each country still needs a feasibility check.
- **World Bank WDI `SP.REG.BRTH.ZS` metadata and indicator series**: Use as the official metadata guardrail that defines the SDG survey indicator and warns against conflating it with CRVS completeness. Limitation: country-level only; no direct role in district prioritization.
- **WHO CRVS fact sheet and WHO-UNICEF health-sector CRVS guidance**: Use to justify why birth registration belongs in a health-service workflow discussion and to name plausible touchpoints such as facility birth, postnatal care, or immunization. Limitation: guidance and systems framing are not outcome proof.

### Limited

- **National CRVS administrative tabulations**: Use only after documenting the legal registration window, denominator, and publication lag. The same country can report high eventual registration but weak on-time registration, and those are different operational problems.
- **Health facility birth-notification systems**: Use as workflow evidence for where registration opportunity exists, not as proof that registration was completed. Notification, application, and final registration are separate states.
- **Immunization or child-health registries**: Use for missed-opportunity hypotheses only when the touchpoint, age window, denominator, and facility catchment are explicit. High immunization coverage is not enough if registry linkage to civil registration is absent.

### Rejected

- **Standalone legal-identity strategy papers without source tables**: Reject for canonical comparison because they often summarize ambition, not measurable registration performance.
- **One-off NGO project reports claiming registration impact without a comparator dataset**: Reject when they do not preserve the measure family, the timing rule, or a checkable denominator.

## Required Properties

- Measure family: under-5 survey registration, certificate possession, or administrative live-birth completeness.
- Data year and time reference.
- Geographic grain and whether sub-national identifiers are preserved.
- Numerator and denominator definition.
- License, access conditions, and whether microdata require approval.
- Known mismatch against other measure families.
- Health-touchpoint relevance, if the source is being used to support service-linkage claims.

## Rejection Rule

A source is rejected for canonical comparison if the measure family, date, grain, or access conditions cannot be verified. Sources that are valid only for framing or only for one country should be listed as limited rather than silently generalized. Administrative and service data without clear denominator or catchment definitions may be used as context but not as proof of sub-national registration performance.

## Task Verdict

This inventory satisfies the scoped `source-inventory` task because it classifies more than six candidate source types into usable, limited, and rejected groups with explicit reasons covering:

- measure family
- timing reference
- geographic grain
- health-linkage relevance
- denominator and access constraints

It does **not** satisfy downstream tasks on country feasibility or missed-opportunity analysis. Those require country-specific source checks and should fail if they rely on these classes alone.
